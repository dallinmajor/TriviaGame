# TriviaGame

I have all of my questions and answers texts held in an object. I have it divided into 5 rounds. Each round contains an array with 3 questions. The question for the given round is chosen at random. 

I have a bunch of functions that do various things. But basically i have it were when the start button gets pressed, it emptys that WWII Trivia Title and Start button and then removes the class that is hiding the Quiz box. The first round question is then displayed followed by each answer appearing every second. sortly after that, if the player has not chosen an answer yet, a countdown displays in the top left hand corner. I did this all by setTimeOut functions. If a player anssers before time is up a the grade() function is called which adds a class to the correct answer and a class to the answer chosen. if the answer chosen is not the correct answer its background color is changed to red. If it is correct the background is changed to Blue. After a few seconds the classes are removed again, all the question and answers are cleared and a new round begins doing the same. Once the number of rounds is equal to 5 the score functions is then called which empties all the text and then displays their score in a percent, it shows how many they have correct and how many they missed and then has an option at the bottom to play again. if the play again is clicked it resets the roundCount and all the scores and starts the game over again.
